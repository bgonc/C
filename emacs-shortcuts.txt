# ðŸ“‹ Little Tips to Remember

- **Treemacs** is your file explorer (delete, rename, create files directly).
- **vterm** gives you a real terminal inside Emacs.
- **Copilot** gives suggestions when enabled, and **Copilot Chat** is for full conversations.
- **Magit** (`C-x g`) gives you perfect Git integration without using the terminal manually.
- **C-x 1** is your friend to quickly clean all windows and go back to code.
